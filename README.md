This is a classifier generated with the Janelia Automatic Animal Behavior Annotator (JAABA) to classify rolling as a drosophila larval behavior pattern (Kabra et al., 2013; Ohyama et al., 2015). 

Combining this classifier with the scripts mentioned in cited articles, each time frame per larva will be classified as rolling or not.
